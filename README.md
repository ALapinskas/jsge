2. Render everything in a sequence.
4. Images can be animated, switching their indexes.
5. Tiles can be rendered as layers on top of each other using webgl masks effects.
6. Map centering, cutting off everything that shouldn't rendered, will allow to use huge maps
7. Boundaries could be extracted from tiles and used further.
8. Map objects supports dot(by default) and custom polygon boundaries.
9. Collision detection for dots, lines and polygons included.
10. Boundaries helper drawing as debug option.
